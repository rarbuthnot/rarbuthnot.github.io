Agile software capitalization is a subject a lot of people don't seem to want to talk about.

The attitude I see quite a bit is one of "not my problem", and it turns into a "I just work here" scenario where even the typically strong-opinionated would rather just follow along with a process that is forced upon them even when they know it doesn't sound or feel /right/.
